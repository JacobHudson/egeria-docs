# 0615 Schema Extraction

Schema extraction creates a set of metadata entities that represent how the data is structured in the digital resource. 

This is then either matched with an existing schema or a new schema is created (see [Area 5](/types/5)). This may be completely automated, or with stewards' assistance.
